### About me
I'm a Front-End developer üë®‚Äçüíª <br>I really enjoy reading and passionate about coding.

I have been in touch with the technological area since I was 12 years old, I have been delving more and more into software development and its methodologies, such as TDD and SCRUM. 
My main language is JavaScript, a language for which I have affinity and that today is the basis of the technologies I work with.
